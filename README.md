# Quantum Tokenization and Compression

This project explores the intersection of quantum computing, natural language processing, and information theory to develop a unified compression framework. By mapping classical tokens onto quantum states, I aim to achieve more efficient data representation and compression.

## Classical BPE Analysis

Before exploring quantum approaches, I implemented a classical Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) system to establish baseline performance metrics. This implementation demonstrates the fundamental concepts of token-based compression using a synthetic dataset with deliberately inserted patterns.

### Compression Visualization
![BPE Compression Process](docs/images/tokenizer_comparison/comparison.png)

[View Interactive Visualization](docs/images/tokenizer_comparison/comparison.html)

The heatmap visualization above demonstrates BPE compression:
- **Left**: Original data with frequent (136, 32) byte pairs highlighted in yellow
- **Right**: Compressed data where pairs are replaced with token 999 (red)
- The color intensity represents byte values
- Each replacement reduces storage by one byte while preserving information

### Entropy Analysis
![Entropy Reduction](docs/images/synthesis_results/comparative_results.png)

[View Interactive Analysis](docs/images/synthesis_results/comparative_results.html)

The entropy reduction chart shows:
- Original data entropy: ~5.94 bits per symbol
- Post-compression entropy: ~5.71 bits per symbol
- Achieved entropy reduction: ~0.23 bits per symbol (~4% improvement)

This classical BPE implementation provides a concrete baseline for comparing quantum tokenization approaches.

## üìä Visualizations
