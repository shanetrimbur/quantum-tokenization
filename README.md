# Quantum Tokenization and Compression

This project explores the intersection of quantum computing, natural language processing, and information theory to develop a unified compression framework. By mapping classical tokens onto quantum states, we aim to achieve more efficient data representation and compression.

## üìä Visualizations

### Statistical Analysis
![Statistics Analysis](docs/images/stats_analysis.png)

This visualization provides key insights into our tokenization and compression performance:
- **Token Distribution**: Shows the long-tailed distribution characteristic of natural language, where certain tokens (like common letters "t", "e", "i") appear more frequently
- **Compression Efficiency**: Demonstrates that our quantum-based compression achieves higher efficiency with fewer tokens compared to classical methods
- **Frequency Analysis**: Reveals how quantum tokenization redistributes token weights, suggesting a form of quantum entropy minimization

### Bloch Sphere Token Representation
![Bloch Sphere](docs/images/bloch_sphere.png)

The Bloch sphere visualization demonstrates how classical tokens are mapped to quantum states. Each point represents a token, with:
- Œ∏ (theta) and œÜ (phi) angles determining its quantum state position
- Color gradient indicating token indices
- Clustering patterns suggesting natural quantum "compression" through state similarity

### Token Distribution Analysis
