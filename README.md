# Quantum Tokenization and Compression

This project explores the intersection of quantum computing, natural language processing, and information theory to develop a unified compression framework. By mapping classical tokens onto quantum states, I aim to achieve more efficient data representation and compression.

## üìä Visualizations

### Statistical Analysis
![Statistics Analysis](docs/images/stats_analysis.png)

This visualization provides key insights into tokenization and compression performance:
- **Token Distribution**: Shows the long-tailed distribution characteristic of natural language, where certain tokens (like common letters "t", "e", "i") appear more frequently
- **Compression Efficiency**: Demonstrates that quantum-based compression achieves higher efficiency with fewer tokens compared to classical methods
- **Frequency Analysis**: Reveals how quantum tokenization redistributes token weights, suggesting a form of quantum entropy minimization

### Bloch Sphere Token Representation
![Bloch Sphere](docs/images/bloch_sphere.png)

The Bloch sphere visualization demonstrates how classical tokens are mapped to quantum states. Each point represents a token, with:
- Œ∏ (theta) and œÜ (phi) angles determining its quantum state position
- Color gradient indicating token indices
- Clustering patterns suggesting natural quantum "compression" through state similarity

### Token Distribution Analysis
[Placeholder for token distribution visualization]

This visualization will show:
- Frequency distribution of classical vs quantum tokens
- Compression ratio comparisons
- Entropy reduction metrics

## üéØ Project Goals

1. Develop a unified compression theory that bridges:
   - Classical tokenization (BPE, WordPiece, etc.)
   - Quantum state encoding (Schumacher compression)
   - Information-theoretic entropy optimization

2. Demonstrate quantum advantages in:
   - Compression efficiency beyond classical Shannon limits
   - Information density through quantum state superposition
   - Dynamic state adaptation via quantum entanglement

## üß™ Current Findings

### Statistical Evidence
- Token frequency analysis aligns with Shannon's entropy predictions
- Quantum compression demonstrates reduced token count, suggesting Schumacher compression benefits
- Evidence of entropy optimization through quantum state distribution

### Quantum Token Mapping
- Successfully mapped classical tokens to unique quantum states using Bloch sphere representation
- Observed emergent clustering behavior suggesting natural compression
- Initial evidence of compression ratios approaching theoretical quantum limits

## üõ†Ô∏è Next Steps

1. **Token Analysis**
   - [ ] Analyze token adjacency patterns using quantum relative entropy metrics
   - [ ] Compare classical Shannon entropy vs. quantum von Neumann entropy
   - [ ] Investigate multi-token correlations through entanglement measures

2. **Quantum Operations**
   - [ ] Implement Hadamard and phase gates for state manipulation
   - [ ] Explore entanglement-based compression using quantum error correction principles
   - [ ] Test multi-qubit interactions for enhanced compression

## üî¨ Technical Approach

My approach combines three fundamental areas:

### Classical Tokenization
Based on Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) principles from Sennrich et al. (2015), I implement token merging strategies optimized for quantum state mapping.

### Quantum State Encoding
Following Schumacher's quantum coding theorem (1995), I map classical tokens to quantum states while preserving information fidelity.

### Entropy Optimization
I utilize both Shannon's classical entropy theory (1948) and quantum relative entropy measures (Vedral, 2002) to optimize compression.
